# multiple-output-voltage-regulator
The project is not completely done but very useful
Multiple output voltage regulator using 6 ways DIP switch to chenge voltage output

# circuit of voltage regulator:
I used Altium Designer to create my project.

# Calculating equivalent resistance value
To calculate equivalent resistance value I made a small application in Excel that can quickly help with it.
The operating instructions are in the file ResistorValueCalc.xlsm 

# LTSpice simulation
To simulate design I used LTSpice. The simulation file are in the LTSpice folder. 
In this LTSpice application you can check effect influence, such us ripple, noise.
